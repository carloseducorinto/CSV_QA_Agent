QueryExecutorAgent - Secure Pandas Code Execution with Comprehensive Safety

This module provides secure execution of dynamically generated pandas code with extensive
safety measures, error handling, and fallback strategies. It serves as the critical
security boundary between user input and code execution.

Architecture:
- Sandboxed Execution: Isolated environment with controlled global variables
- Safety Validation: Multi-layer security checks before execution
- Error Recovery: Intelligent fallback strategies for failed operations
- Output Capture: Safe capture of stdout/stderr during execution
- History Tracking: Complete audit trail of all executions
- Timeout Protection: Prevents infinite loops and hanging operations

Security Features:
- Code Pattern Validation: Blocks dangerous operations and imports
- Sandboxed Environment: Limited global scope with safe pandas/numpy access
- Input Sanitization: Variable name cleaning and validation
- Error Containment: Graceful handling of all execution failures
- Audit Logging: Complete traceability of executed code and results

Execution Pipeline:
1. Code safety validation against forbidden patterns
2. Environment setup with sanitized variables
3. Timeout-protected code execution in sandbox
4. Output capture and result extraction
5. Error handling with fallback strategies
6. History logging and performance metrics

Fallback Strategies:
- Basic Exploration: Show data preview when complex operations fail
- Simplified Operations: Fall back to basic statistics (describe)
- Error Analysis: Provide meaningful error messages for debugging
- Graceful Degradation: Always return some useful information

Performance Features:
- Execution timing and metrics
- Memory usage monitoring
- Output size limitations
- Resource cleanup and management

    Secure agent for executing pandas code with comprehensive safety and error handling.
    
    This agent is responsible for the safe execution of dynamically generated pandas code
    while maintaining system security and providing robust error recovery. It implements
    multiple layers of protection against malicious code execution and provides intelligent
    fallback strategies when operations fail.
    
    Core Security Principles:
    - Defense in Depth: Multiple security layers (validation, sandboxing, monitoring)
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Minimal required permissions and access
    - Fail-Safe Defaults: Safe behavior when errors occur
    - Complete Auditing: Full traceability of all operations
    - Resource Protection: Timeout and memory usage controls
    
    Key Capabilities:
    - Secure code execution in controlled environment
    - Comprehensive safety validation against dangerous patterns
    - Intelligent error recovery with multiple fallback strategies
    - Complete audit trail with performance metrics
    - Output capture and result extraction
    - Variable name sanitization and environment isolation
    
    Architecture Components:
    - Safe Globals: Controlled global environment with pandas/numpy
    - Pattern Validator: Regex-based detection of dangerous code patterns
    - Execution Sandbox: Isolated execution environment with I/O capture
    - Fallback Engine: Multiple recovery strategies for failed operations
    - History Tracker: Complete audit log of all execution attempts

        Comprehensive security validation to check for potentially dangerous code patterns.
        
        This critical security function implements defense-in-depth by checking for
        various categories of dangerous operations that could compromise system security
        or stability. It uses regex pattern matching to detect prohibited operations.

            dict: Validation result with safety status and reason
            
        Security Categories Checked:
        - System Access: os, sys, subprocess operations
        - Code Injection: eval, exec, compile functions
        - File Operations: file reading/writing, directory operations
        - Network Access: HTTP, FTP, socket operations
        - Process Control: threading, multiprocessing, system calls
        - Environment Access: environment variables, system information
        - Import Controls: preventing arbitrary module imports
        
        Defense Strategy:
        - Blacklist Approach: Block known dangerous patterns
        - Comprehensive Coverage: Multiple variations of dangerous operations
        - Case Insensitive: Prevent case-based evasion attempts
        - Regular Expressions: Flexible pattern matching
